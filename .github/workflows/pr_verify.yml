            Checklist:
            
            - [ ] Is this release [${{ env.RELVER }}] of ${{ env.APPNAME }}?
            - [ ] Have you updated `app/${{ env.APPNAME }}.qvf`?
            
            If you wish to merge:

            - Have this PR approved by a code owner
            - Merge this PR into main
            - Go to releases, an action will generate a draft release with docs + attached QVF
            - Make any updates, then submit the release

            Common issues:
            
            - Version number missing or incorrect (./VERSION file needs updating)
            - After merging, draft release doesn't update - this is usually because
              the action failed due to an old draft release with the same name.
              Delete the draft release, and re-run the action.
